Game made for Game Off 2021 game jam, theme Bug.

A company's distributed network is under attack by waves of viruses that's been leaked through bugs within the system. Your job is to stop these waves of attacks and protect from the network from getting compromised.

The inspiration for this game came from the idea of IoT (internet of things) devices being hacked through vulnerabilities. Simplified the initial idea and abstracted to how it currently is today.
